#### **[step-5-javascript-validation-pipeline.md](./step-5-javascript-validation-pipeline.md)**
**Goal:** Refactor JS validation for better organization  
**Priority:** LOW-MEDIUM  
**Time Estimate:** 6-8 hours  
**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**ROI:** üü° Medium

**Why do this:**
- Clearer file organization
- Easier to add new checks
- Less code duplication
- Better maintainability

**What you get:**
- Restructured validation directories
- Standardized check patterns
- Common utilities extracted
- Developer guide for adding checks

**When to do:** After automated testing is in place  
**Next action:** Begin Phase 1 - Current State Analysis

---

#### **[step-8-performance-optimization.md](./step-8-performance-optimization.md)** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEASURE FIRST
**Goal:** Optimize performance if metrics show need  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Time Estimate:** 4-8 hours  
**Complexity:** MEDIUM  
**ROI:** üü° Medium (only if needed)

**Why do this:**
- ONLY if performance issues reported
- ONLY if metrics show problems
- Don't optimize prematurely

**What you get:**
- Bundle size reduction
- Runtime performance improvements
- Database query optimization
- Measurable speed improvements

**When to do:** ONLY after measuring and confirming issues  
**Next action:** Phase 1 - Performance Measurement (then decide)

## Recommended Implementation Order

Based on priority, ROI, and dependencies:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) ‚≠ê START HERE
1. **Step 7: Documentation Improvements** (4-6 hours)
   - Quick win, high value
   - Helps with all future work
   - Low complexity, immediate benefit

2. **Step 4: Automated Testing** (14-20 hours)
   - Most important for long-term health
   - Enables confident refactoring
   - Prevents future issues

### Phase 2: Refinement (Weeks 3-4)
3. **Dead Code Review** (from next-steps.md, 8-12 hours)
   - Systematic audit with tests to catch issues
   - Remove remaining unused code
   - Tests make this safer

### Phase 3: Polish (Month 2+)
4. **Step 5: JS Validation Pipeline** (6-8 hours)
   - Refactor with test coverage
   - Improve code organization
   - Make future changes easier

5. **Step 8: Performance Optimization** (4-8 hours)
   - ONLY if metrics show need
   - Measure, then optimize
   - Don't guess what's slow
